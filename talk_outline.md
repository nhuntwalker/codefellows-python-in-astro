# Python Applied: Programming for the Stars

**Package focuses:**

- AstroPy
- Scikit-Learn
- AstroML
- GatsPy

Astronomy is visual, but also heavily mathematical. So much python work is numerical analysis then visualization of the results.

For time domain, show examples of planetary transits, RR lyrae luminosity-distance relationships, try to get light curves from AAVSO maybe? walk through analysis of AD Leo flaring rate. Use gatspy for the starspot rotation period.

For extragalactic, show plot of luminosity_distance vs redshift vs position. Use astropy.cosmology.Planck13.luminosity_distance. Also, use data from DR8

Get Ethan's planetary animation; done with matplotlib
